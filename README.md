## About Me
---

Hi, Iâ€™m Divya! Iâ€™m a second-year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, and Iâ€™m seeking internship opportunities in machine learning or software engineering! I have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, machine learning, and software development, and my interests lie in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. Iâ€™m currently taking courses to explore the field of computer science and expand my interests. I hope to help bridge the gap between humans and technology and make impactful contributions to society. While Iâ€™m still exploring the different areas of computer science, my end goal is to leverage my skills to revolutionize education and different learning platforms. I look forward to connecting with fellow peers, professionals, and mentors who have similar interests!
