Hi, Iâ€™m Divya (she/her)! Iâ€™m a third-year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, and Iâ€™m seeking internship opportunities in machine learning or software engineering! I have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, machine learning, and software development, and my interests lie in machine learning and human-computer interaction. I hope to leverage my skills to contribute to AI for healthcare or content discovery and recommendation systems research. Upon graduating, I plan to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree and expand my expertise in machine learning. I aim to help bridge the gap between humans and technology and make impactful contributions to society. I look forward to connecting with fellow peers, professionals, and mentors who have similar interests!
